As much as 75% of all health record data is found in unstructured text such as physician's notes, discharge summaries, test results, and case notes.

Amazon Comprehend Medical uses advanced machine learning models to accurately and quickly identify medical information, such as medical conditions and medications, and determines their relationship to each other, for instance, medicine dosage and strength. Amazon Comprehend Medical can also link the detected information to medical ontologies such as ICD-10-CM or RxNorm\n",
